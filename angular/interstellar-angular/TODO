  ☐ ROUTING
    ☐ ALL CHILD ROUTING REVIEW    
    ☐ HANDLE ALL 404'S AND REDIRECTS
  ******************
    
  ☐ "Business Side"
    * Finalize name (Interstellar might not be received well in the competition given it uses "stellar").
    ☐ Logo and branding (color scheme and feel).
    * User acquisition.
    
  ☐ MODULES 
    √ Home (still need to figure out what this should be used for, or get rid of it)
    √ Categories
    * Category Pages | needs search and product filtering within category
    * Users | needs user search and filtering by ratings
    * User (or "Merchant") Profiles | needs selective information output depending on  
    √ Cart
    * Checkout Process | few bugs to work out (payment failures).
    √ Chat
    
    **** Tyler ****
    √ CREATE USER-ESQUE MODULE... PROFILE... USER LIST...     
    √ HOME MODULE... MAIN PAGES
    ***************

  ☐ UI
    * Theming - Currently angular & MDbootstrap.  
    √ Categories - Show categories in a card format. Helps with filtering.    
    * Category Feeds - Show category products in a card format. Allow filtering by tags assigned to products 
      (when user initially uploads).    
    * People - Show all merchants in a card format and allow search. ****question**** Should we allow filtering of merchants? 
    √ Chat - Messaging between buyers and sellers on the platform. Allows transparency and keeps the service from feeling 
      like a "black box".    
    √ Checkout Cart - Show items in cart and allow buy/remove selected and buy/remove all. Checkout should be step by step 
      process and information verified.   
    * Profiles - Show information depending on if it is the users profile or another's profile. | In process (currently using 
      cheap html workarounds)

  ☐ FEATURES
    √ Chat   
    ☐ Shipping
      ☐ Shipping process should be easy for merchants and users. Anything we can handle on our end to enable merchants when 
        shipping. | Not a priority (chat already allows information exchange) 
      ☐ Either: ask for shipping information from users at checkout or when they create an account      
    ☐ Search
      ☐ On individual category pages to filter by things like merchant rating, price, and more specific category details.
      ☐ On the people page to allow users to find reputable merchant (*does it make sense to have a people page? Or should 
        users be accessing merchant profiles only through product listings?*)      
    ☐ Merchant ratings/reviews - allow users who bought a product to review the merchant who sold them the product. This is an 
      important feature to give users confidence when purchasing over the platform.
      ☐ Seller history with associated ratings (if given) should be visisible on each merchant profile.    
    * Price Anchor - Anchor item price in lumens to USD value. Allows merchants to be confident in the price they get for their 
      product at time of sale. Is necessary until cryptocurrency becomes more ubiquitous and less volatile. | *Status unknown (Tyler)*
      * Pull from live feed
